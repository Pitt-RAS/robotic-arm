savox servo can only be told inputs between 6 and 179 degrees for some reason lol
all the servos have the same number of teeth spline so any horn works for any servo

Servo degree mapping notes:
Black servo, inputs: 6-179, outputs: 0-177
Blue servo, inputs: 0-180, outputs: 0-268
Red servo, inputs: 0-180, outputs: 0-260
